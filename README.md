# MANE 3351 - Manufacturing Engineering Analysis

## Laboratory 7 Assignment

#### Assigned: October 24, 2022

#### Due: October 24, 2022 (before 3:30 pm)

---

#### Learning Goals

1.  Use Python control statements
2. Modify Matplotlib parameters to customize plots

#### Description

Cell two demonstrates calculating $P(X<a)$ for the smallest extreme value distribution from lab six. In lab seven, the gumbel_l function from Scipy.stats replaces the user-defined SEV function from Lab 6. Cell two generates a plot of the problem using matplotlib.

Your assignment is to implement in cell three $P(X>a)$ with the corresponding graph. You are to also change all of the parameters in matplotlib to change the fill color, color of the lines and line marker style.


#### Step 1

Copy code from cell 2 and paste into cell 3.

#### Step 2

To find $P(X>a)$ you can use use the complete of the CDF function or use the SF (survival function),

#### Step 3

Modify the matplotlib parameters to create a new, unique graph.

#### Step 4

After running and testing your program, save the Jupyter Notebook. Upload your repository using GitHub desktop.
